#default

this roles main purpose is to install some useful default utilities on the system we like to have
like htop, mc, etc.

It also disables the 'ufw' firewall on all nodes and get rid of the cloud init stuff from ubuntu.

##ufw

since we disable the local system firewall, please ensure that your are having a correctly configured public firewall!
